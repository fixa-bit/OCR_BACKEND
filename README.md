# Urdu OCR System

## Overview

This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system specifically designed for recognizing Urdu text in both PDFs and images. The system utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to accurately extract text from various document formats and integrate it into existing applications or systems.

## Features

- **OCR for Urdu Text**: Extracts text from PDFs and images containing Urdu script.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes trained ML models for accurate text recognition.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed to work seamlessly across different platforms.
- **API Integration**: Easily integrates with existing systems via RESTful APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Trained ML models for text recognition and processing.
- **Python**: Core language for backend development, including data manipulation, ML model training, and deployment.
- **Dart & Flutter**: Used for developing cross-platform applications with a focus on UI/UX.
- **Flask**: Backend framework for API development and serving the OCR models.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Dart & Flutter SDK
- Flask
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Model Training & Deployment
Model Training: The OCR models were trained using a large dataset of Urdu text documents, employing advanced machine learning techniques. The training pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **Deployment:** The trained models are deployed using Flask, ensuring seamless integration with the backend API. The system is optimized for performance, handling real-time requests efficiently.
